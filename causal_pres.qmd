## G-formula

Key idea:

Using counterfactuals we are able to get a better idea of the treatement effects.

Assumptions:

1. Counterfactual consistency:
2. Exchangeability:
3. Positivity:

::: {.notes}
In the motivating example, A0 is the first treatment, Z1 is the viral load, A1 is the second treatment, Y is the CD4, and u is the unmeasured confounder on viral load and CD4.

The main idea is to use counterfactuals to create an estimation of average effects.

- Sound similar?

## IP - Weighting and MSMs

- Goal: Create a pseudo-population in which there is no association between the covariates $L$ and the Treatment $A$.

:::{.def}
The weights for IP weighting are found by
$$
W^A = \frac{p}{f(A|L)}, \quad 0 < p < 1
$$
The choice of $p$ is determined such that the pseudo-population probability of treatment will not depend on the cofounders.

# G-computation


## G-computation: Overview

- Originates from Robins (1986).
- Directly models the **counterfactual outcomes**.
- Steps:
  1. Fit a model for the outcome based on treatment and confounders.
  2. Predict outcomes for everyone under each treatment condition.
  3. Average predicted outcomes to estimate the treatment effect.



## G-computation: Assumptions

- **No unmeasured confounding**: All confounders must be measured and correctly included in the model.
- **Correct model specification**: The model for the outcome must be correctly specified.
- **Positivity (Overlap)**: There must be non-zero probability of receiving each treatment for all levels of confounders.
- **Consistency**: The potential outcome under the observed treatment equals the actual observed outcome.



## G-formula: Overview

- **G-formula** (Generalized Intervention Formula) is a **mathematical representation** of the distribution of outcomes under interventions.
- Provides a way to calculate the **counterfactual outcome distribution** if we intervene to assign treatment $A = a$.
- **G-computation** uses the G-formula to estimate causal effects.

$$
P(Y(a)) = \sum_{L} P(Y \mid A=a, L) P(L)
$$

:::{.subsubtext}

Where:
  $Y(a)$: Potential outcome under treatment $a$.  
  $A$: Treatment or exposure.  
  $L$: Confounders.  
  $P(Y \mid A=a, L)$: Conditional distribution of the outcome given treatment and confounders.

## What does the G-formula estimate? 

:::{.incremental}
- The **counterfactual distribution** of outcomes if everyone in the population received treatment $A = a$.
- It models the causal effect of treatment by adjusting for confounding factors (e.g., age, comorbidities).
:::


## G-formula: Steps

1. **Model outcome** $Y$ as a function of treatment $A$ and confounders $L$.
2. **Predict counterfactual outcomes** $Y(a)$ by intervening on the treatment (i.e., fixing $A = a$).
3. **Average outcomes** to estimate the expected outcome under treatment $a$.
4. Repeat for other treatment levels to compare effects.



## G-formula: Assumptions

- **No unmeasured confounding**: All confounders affecting treatment and outcome must be measured.
- **Correct model specification**: The model used for the outcome must be correctly specified.
- **Positivity**: There must be a positive probability of receiving each treatment for all combinations of confounders.
- **Consistency**: Observed outcomes under the given treatment match the potential outcomes.



## How does the G-formula relate to G-computation?

:::{.incremental}
- The **G-formula** is a mathematical formula representing the counterfactual distribution.
- **G-computation** is the **algorithmic procedure** used to implement the G-formula to estimate causal effects in practice.
:::


## Example: Applying the G-formula

1. Fit a model for $Y$ as a function of $A$ and $L$.
2. Use this model to predict outcomes $Y(a)$ if everyone received treatment $a$.
3. Average the predicted outcomes to get the causal effect of treatment $a$.
